# Codes used for compression and denoising of X-ray computed tomography images with AI

- Models used have a CNN and VQ-VAE architecture with customizable number of layers.

- Codes used to evaluate the quality of the recovered images after compression are also included. The evaluation was done for 8-bit and binary images.

The work related to these scripts are currently published. Please use appropriate citation for the published article titled "D-CNN and VQ-VAE Autoencoders for Compression and Denoising of Industrial X-ray Computed Tomography Images"
